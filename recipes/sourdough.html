    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>During the pandemic, I rediscovered the joys of baking with an incredible sourdough recipe. 
        The process of tending to the starter, watching it come to life, and crafting it into a perfect loaf was incredibly soothing. 
        Each step, from the rhythmic kneading to the anticipation of the rise, provided a welcome respite from the uncertainty of those times. 
        The smell of freshly baked sourdough filling the house was a balm, making each day a little more comforting and connected to simpler pleasures.
    </p>

    <p>This newfound hobby soon became a way to give back to the community. 
        I began baking extra loaves and selling them to friends, family, and neighbors, donating the proceeds to local charities. 
        The response was heartwarming; people loved the tangy, chewy bread, and knowing that their purchase was helping those in need made it even sweeter. 
        What started as a therapeutic pastime turned into a mission of kindness, bridging our isolated lives with acts of generosity and delicious, homemade bread.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (240g) active sourdough starter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (360ml) warm water</li>
        <li>4 cups (500g) bread flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix the sourdough starter and warm water until combined.</li>
            <li>Add the bread flour and salt, mixing until a rough dough forms.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let it rise at room temperature for 4-6 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Shape the dough into a round loaf and place it in a floured proofing basket. Cover and let it rise for another 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) with a Dutch oven inside.</li>
            <li>Carefully transfer the dough to the hot Dutch oven, score the top with a sharp knife, and cover with the lid.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20 minutes, then remove the lid and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
